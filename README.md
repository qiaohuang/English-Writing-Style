# English-Writing-Style

The guide proposes rules that help standardize English writing. I'm using it to make my writing more consistent. 
Content on [my site](https://www.uniqiao.com) is an example.

## Rules

Organized in alphabetical order.

### Abbreviation

Use abbreviations to achieve a friendly tone — like `the US`, `we'll`, and `app`.

### Article

If the noun at issue is too generic and needs to be specified, use the definite article `the`. 
Otherwise, use the indefinite article `a` or `an`, or don't use any article. 
Check out [Articles: A Complete Grammar Guide](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/articles/) by Grammarly for more details.

### Capitalization

There are two major capitalization styles for headlines and titles: sentence case and title case. 
In sentence case, only the first letter of the first word and proper nouns are capitalized, 
whereas in title case, all words except for articles, conjunctions, and short prepositions are capitalized. 
Use [Headline Capitalization](https://headlinecapitalization.com) to make sure headlines and titles are properly written.

For file extensions, use either XXX or .xxx. For example, `SVG` or `.svg`.

### Colon

Colons always go outside of bold formatting. 
The first letter of a complete sentence following a colon should be capitalized.

### Dash

There are three kinds of dashes — hyphen, en dash, and the em dash. 
Read more about [hyphen](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/hyphen/) and [dashes](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/dash/) at Grammarly.

- Hyphen `-` join words or parts of words. Use a hyphen in a compound modifier when the modifier comes before the word it's modifying. 
  For example, `click-through rate`.
- En dash `–` has the length of the letter N. Use the en dash to indicate spans of time or range of numbers, for example, `7:00–8:00 am`. 
  The en dash may also be used to indicate a connection between two words, for example, `north–south railway`.
- Em dash `—` has the length of the letter M. Use the em dash to join parts of sentences. There are already examples in this guide. 
  For more usage, read [em dash](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-you-should-love-the-em-dash/) at Grammarly.

### Emoji/Emoticon

Separate the emoji/emoticon from the text with a space. Emojis/Emoticons don't replace punctuation.

### Heading

Use level 1–3 headings. Too many layers of heading undermine readability.

### List

Use unordered lists, unless describing sequential operations.

It's hard to read when the noun is preceded by more than two modifiers. You can use possessive to deal with multiple modifiers, 
generally, use `'s` after a living organism and a brand, while use `of` for possessive of a lifeless object.

### Spelling

Use American English. American and British English can be differentiated in [three ways](https://www.enago.com/documents/resources/BrE-AmE.pdf).

### Tense

Use the simple present tense. Avoid awkward future tense like `will be doing`.

### Voice

Use active voice, avoid slang and jargon, and write positively.
